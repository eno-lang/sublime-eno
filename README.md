# sublime-eno

This package adds syntax highlighting for the [eno notation language](https://eno-lang.org).

By default the custom `eno dark` color scheme is pre-configured for all eno documents,
you can override this with the also supplied `eno light` theme or any other theme in your
syntax-specific settings for eno documents.
